autoheight.js
==========

Textareas with automatically adjusted height.

There are three files in the `src` directory:
  * autoheight.js - use it with pure javascript
  * jquery-autoheight.js - jquery plugin
  * angular-autoheight.js - angularjs directive

The functionality is the same in all three versions.
